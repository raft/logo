The files [solo.svg](solo.svg) and [sticker.svg](sticker.svg) are vectorized
versions based on Annie's original raster (PNG) files. The log raft and clouds
were traced automatically using Inkscape.  The sky was made slightly darker and
more blue to increase contrast with the "raft.github.io" text.  The font used
is v1.x of [Comfortaa](https://github.com/ongardie/Comfortaa/tree/master/v1.x)
(note that the *f* and *t* in 'raft' look different in v2.x).
